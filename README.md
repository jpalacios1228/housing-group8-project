Housing group 8 Project

The goal for this project is to see if we are able to find a solution to the housing problem for
the newer generation in the United States. The team is going to find housing data such as,
price, location, size of houses, population, disposable income, mortgage rate, and
unemployment rate. The outcome of using this data is to find the patterns of buying a
house throughout the years, and to see if there is a solution to buying a house. We have
chosen this data set since it would give us a picture on how much house prices have
changed compared to the income of the buyer throughout the years. The results of the
project should give a clear idea on what houses to buy if it is possible to buy them
